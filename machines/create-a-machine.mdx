<Warning>
You must have created a Project in Artemis Search before you can add a Machine. See our guide on [creating a project](/projects/create-a-project) for more information.
</Warning>

## Steps to Add a Machine

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the Project Page">
    Open the Artemis Search dashboard and select the project that you'd like to create a machine for.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Locate the Machines Card">
    On the project page, find the "Machines" card. This card displays a table of all current machines in your project.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click 'Add Machine'">
    At the bottom of the Machines table, click the "Add Machine" button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for Machine Creation">
    The process of creating a new machine will begin. This may take some time, so please remain on the page until the process completes.
    <Warning>
    Do not navigate away from the page while the machine is being created, as this may interrupt the process.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Machine Status">
    Once the machine creation process is complete, you should see the new machine listed in the Machines table.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## After Creating a Machine

Once you've successfully created a machine:

- Your project will become active if you've already activated a dataset
- The new machine will automatically start handling search requests
- You can monitor its performance in the Project Status card on the project page

<Tip>
If you need to add multiple machines, you can repeat this process as needed. Remember, more machines can help handle higher loads, but may also increase costs.
