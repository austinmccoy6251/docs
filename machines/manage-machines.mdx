## Best Practices for Machine Management

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Frequently check the status and performance of your machines.
2. **Scale Responsively**: Add machines when you notice increased load or slower response times.
3. **Cost Optimization**: Remove unnecessary machines during periods of lower demand.
4. **Maintain Minimum Requirements**: Ensure at least one machine is always active for each project.
5. **Balance Performance and Cost**: Find the right number of machines to meet your performance needs while managing costs effectively.

<Tip>
Remember, your project must have at least one machine to remain active. If you delete all machines, your project will become inactive and unable to process search requests.
</Tip>
