---

Machines are a core component of Artemis Search's technology, enabling high-performance, intelligent searches on your datasets. This page will help you understand what machines are, how they work, and why they're crucial for your search projects.

## What are Machines?

Machines in Artemis Search are computational resources dedicated to running our advanced ML model on your active datasets.

Machines are responsible for processing search requests and performing the "intelligent" searches that set Artemis Search apart from traditional search engines and RAG systems.

## Key Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Purpose">
    Machines run our ML model to perform reasoning-based searches on your datasets, allowing for more accurate and context-aware results.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scalability">
    You can add multiple machines to a project to handle increased load and improve response times.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Load Balancing">
    Search requests are automatically distributed among available machines to optimize performance.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Project Activation">
    At least one machine must be assigned to a project for it to be considered "active" and ready for use.

## Machine States

Machines in Artemis Search can be in different states:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Starting" icon="rocket">
    The machine is being initialized and prepared for use.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Running" icon="play">
    The machine is active and ready to process search requests.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Stopping" icon="stop">
    The machine is in the process of being shut down.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Stopped" icon="power-off">
    The machine is not running and cannot process requests.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Best Practices

To get the most out of your machines in Artemis Search:

1. Start with at least one machine per project to ensure it's active.
2. Monitor your project's performance and add machines as needed to handle increased load.
3. Consider removing unnecessary machines to optimize costs when demand is lower.
4. Regularly check the status of your machines in your project page.

<Tip>
Remember, you need both an active dataset and at least one machine assigned to a project for it to be operational in the playground.
