## What are Machines?

Machines in Artemis Search are the computational resources that run and execute your project's searches.

## Key Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Purpose">
    Machines are responsible for handling and completing your searches.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scalability">
    You can add multiple machines to a project to handle increased load and improve response times.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Load Balancing">
    Search requests are automatically distributed among available machines to optimize performance.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Project Activation">
    At least one machine must be assigned to a project for it to be considered "active" and ready for use.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## Best Practices

To get the most out of your machines in Artemis Search:

1. Start with at least one machine per project to ensure it's active.
2. Monitor your project's performance and add machines as needed to handle increased load.
3. Consider removing unnecessary machines to optimize costs when demand is lower.
4. Regularly check the status of your machines in your project page.

<Tip>
Remember, you need both an active dataset and at least one machine assigned to a project for it to be operational in the playground.
