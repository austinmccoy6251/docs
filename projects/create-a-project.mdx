  Select a name that clearly indicates the purpose of your search task. This will help you and your team members easily identify and manage projects.

<Accordion title="Plan Your Dataset">
  Before creating a project, have a clear idea of the dataset you'll be using. Remember, each dataset must be a pickled pandas dataframe with specific requirements.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Consider Resource Allocation">
  Think about how many machines you'll need for your project based on the expected search volume and complexity.
  <Note>
    If the search seems slow, you can add more machines to the project.
