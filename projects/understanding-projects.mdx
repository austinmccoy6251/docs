Projects are the top-level entities in Artemis Search. Each project is dedicated to a particular search task, allowing you to efficiently manage and configure your intelligent searches.

## What is a Project?

A project in Artemis Search contains:

- One or more datasets
- One or more machines
- Configuration settings for your search task

<Note>
  Projects are designed to isolate different search tasks. For example, if you're creating a search for companies, you'd dedicate one project to it.

## Key Components of a Project

  <Card title="Datasets" icon="database">
    Collections of embeddings and associated tags that you want to search through.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Machines" icon="server">
    Computational resources that respond to search requests and run our ML model on the active dataset.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Model Type" icon="microchip">
    Currently, only the "Mini" model type is available for all projects.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Configuration" icon="gears">
    Settings that define how your project operates and processes search queries.

## Project Status

The status (active/inactive) of your project is determined by two main factors:

1. **Active Dataset**: At least one dataset must be activated for the project to be operational.
2. **Assigned Machines**: The project needs at least one machine assigned to process search requests.

<Warning>
  Your project must have both an active dataset and at least one assigned machine to be considered "active" and ready for use in the playground.
</Warning>

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basics of projects in Artemis Search, you're ready to:
