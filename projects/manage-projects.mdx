Once you've created a project in Artemis Search, you'll need to manage various aspects to ensure it's running efficiently and meeting your search needs. This guide covers the key management tasks for your projects.

## Project Details

<Accordion title="Edit Project Information">
  To edit your project's name, description, or model type:

  1. Navigate to the project page
  2. Locate the "Project Details" card
  3. Make your changes
  4. Click "Save Changes" in the top-right corner of the page
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Delete a Project">
  <Warning>
    Deleting a project is irreversible. Make sure you want to permanently remove the project and all its associated data.
  </Warning>

  To delete a project:

  1. Go to the project page
  2. Click the "Delete" button in the top-right corner
  3. Confirm the deletion when prompted
</Accordion>

## Managing Datasets

<Accordion title="Add a Dataset">
  To add a dataset to your project:

  1. Find the "Datasets" card on the project page
  2. Click "Add Dataset" at the bottom of the table
  3. Name your dataset and upload the file
  4. Wait for the upload to complete (stay on the page during this process)

  <Note>
    Each dataset must be a pickled pandas dataframe with an "embedding" column (containing OpenAI text-large-3 embeddings) and a "tag" column (containing associated string values).
  </Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Activate a Dataset">
  To set a dataset as active for your project:

  1. In the "Datasets" table, click the ellipsis (...) next to the dataset
  2. Select "Activate"

  <Warning>
    Only one dataset can be active per project. Activating a new dataset will deactivate the currently active one.
  </Warning>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Edit or Delete a Dataset">
  To edit a dataset's name or delete it:

  1. Click the ellipsis (...) next to the dataset in the "Datasets" table
  2. Choose "Edit" to rename the dataset, or "Delete" to remove it
</Accordion>

## Managing Machines

<Accordion title="Add a Machine">
  To add a machine to your project:

  1. Locate the "Machines" card on the project page
  2. Click "Add Machine" at the bottom of the table
  3. Wait for the machine to start up (stay on the page during this process)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Delete a Machine">
  To remove a machine from your project:

  1. In the "Machines" table, click the ellipsis (...) next to the machine
  2. Select "Delete"
  3. Wait for the deletion process to complete
</Accordion>

<Note>
  Your project must have at least one machine to be active. Machines automatically handle load balancing for search requests.
</Note>

## Project Status

Monitor your project's status using the Project Status card, which displays:

- Monthly Accrued Cost (coming soon)
- Active Machines
- Uptime (coming soon)
- Requests (coming soon)

## Using the Playground

Once your project is active (has an active dataset and at least one machine), you can use it in the playground:

1. Navigate to the project page
2. Click "Open in Playground" in the top-right corner

In the playground, you can:

- Configure search settings
- Enter search queries
- View paginated search results

<Tip>
  The playground is an excellent way to test and refine your search queries before integrating them into your application.
</Tip>

## Next Steps

Now that you know how to manage your projects, you might want to:

- Learn about [API integration](/api-reference/introduction) to incorporate Artemis Search into your applications
- Explore [advanced search techniques](/advanced-search) to optimize your queries
