## Project Details

<Accordion title="Edit Project Details">
  To edit your project's name, description, or model type:

  1. Edit details in the "Project Details" card from your project page
  2. Click "Save Changes" in the top-right corner of the page
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Delete a Project">

  To delete a project:

</Accordion>

## Managing Datasets

<Accordion title="Add a Dataset">
  To add a dataset to your project:

  3. Name your dataset and upload the file
  4. Wait for the upload to complete (stay on the page during this process)

  To set a dataset as active for your project:

  1. In the "Datasets" table, click the ellipsis (⋮) next to the dataset

## Project Status

Monitor your project's status using the Project Status card in the project page, which displays:

- Monthly Accrued Cost (coming soon)
- Active Machines
- Uptime (coming soon)
- Requests (coming soon)

## Using the Playground

The playground is a tool that allows you to experiment with your project.

<Warning>
  Your project must have an active dataset and at least one machine to use the playground.
</Warning>
Once your project is active (has an active dataset and at least one machine), you can use it in the playground:

You can access the playground in two ways:

1. Click the "Playground" button in the top-right corner of the project page
2. Navigate to the "Playground" tab on the project page and select your project under "Project" in "Settings"
