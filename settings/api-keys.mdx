API keys are used to authenticate your requests when using the Artemis Search API. This page explains how to manage and use your API keys securely.

<Warning>
  Never share your API keys publicly or commit them to version control systems.
</Warning>

## Accessing Your API Key

You can access your API key from the "Secrets" tab in your account settings. Learn more about account settings [here](/settings/account-settings).

## Using Your API Key

To authenticate API requests, include your API key in the `Authorization` header of requests.



```javascript
fetch('https://api.search-artemis.com/api/fly-search', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
    searchQuery: 'companies that require HIPAA compliance',
    numberOfBatches: 50,
    topK: 5
  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
```


## Best Practices


<Accordion title="Rate Limiting">
  API requests are subject to rate limiting to ensure fair usage. Current limits are 

  - 30 requests per minute for standard accounts

  <Note>
    Exceeding these limits will result in a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
  </Note>
</Accordion>

For any issues with API keys or to request increased rate limits, please contact our support team at [pallavi@artemisar.com](mailto:pallavi@artemisar.com).
