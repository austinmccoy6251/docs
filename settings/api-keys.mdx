# API Keys

API keys are used to authenticate your requests when using the Artemis Search API. This page explains how to manage and use your API keys securely.

<Warning>
  Never share your API keys publicly or commit them to version control systems.
</Warning>

## Using Your API Key

To authenticate API requests, include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

<CodeGroup>
```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.search-artemis.com/v1/projects" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```python
import requests

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
}

response = requests.get("https://api.search-artemis.com/v1/projects", headers=headers)
```

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const headers = {
  'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
};

axios.get('https://api.search-artemis.com/v1/projects', { headers })
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });
```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

<Accordion title="Security Tips">
  - Store API keys securely, such as in environment variables or a secure key management system.
  - Use different API keys for development and production environments.
  - Implement IP whitelisting for additional security.
  - Monitor API key usage and set up alerts for unusual activity.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Rate Limiting">
  API requests are subject to rate limiting to ensure fair usage. Current limits are:

  - 1000 requests per minute for standard accounts
  - 5000 requests per minute for enterprise accounts

  <Note>
    Exceeding these limits will result in a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
  </Note>
</Accordion>

For any issues with API keys or to request increased rate limits, please contact our support team at [pallavi@artemisar.com](mailto:pallavi@artemisar.com).
