## Billing Factors

Our billing is based on two primary factors:

1. **Active Machines**: The number of active machines you have running across all your projects.
2. **Number of Requests**: The total number of search requests made to your projects.

<Note>
  Billing cycles are on a monthly basis, aligning with your usage patterns over time.
</Note>

## Beta Status and Billing Waiver

<Info>
  Artemis Search is currently in beta. During this phase, all billing is waived for our users.
</Info>

We're excited to have you on board as we refine and improve our product. While we're in beta:

- All features are fully accessible
- Usage limits may apply to ensure fair access for all beta users
- We're actively collecting feedback to improve our service

We'll provide ample notice before any changes to our billing structure or the conclusion of the beta period.

## Future Billing Implementation

Once we move out of beta, we plan to implement our billing system as follows:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Usage Tracking">
    We'll track your active machines and requests throughout the month.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monthly Invoice">
    At the end of each billing cycle, we'll generate an invoice based on your usage.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Payment Processing">
    Payment will be collected via the payment method you have on file.
  </Step>
</Steps>
