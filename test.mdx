Our technology allows you to perform "intelligent" searches on datasets consisting of embeddings and associated tags. This search is designed to excel at searches that require "reasoning" and outperforms RAG. For example, if you search "companies that require HIPAA compliance", our technology will truly return companies that match this criteria.

<Note>
  To get started right away, use our interactive [Intelligent Search Playground](#) (coming soon).

## 1. Get an API key

You need an API key to make calls to your project. Connect with us to generate a key:

<Card title="Generate API Key" icon="key" href="#">
  Click here to generate your API key
</Card>

Copy your generated key:

```bash
SEARCH_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Alternatively, you can [create a new API key](#) in your account settings.

## 2. Install the SDK

Our SDK provides a simple interface for interacting with your intelligent search database. Install it using pip:

```bash
pip install intelligent-search-sdk
```

## 3. Initialize a client

Initialize a client with your API key:

```python
from intelligent_search import SearchClient

client = SearchClient(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
```

## 4. Create a project

Create a project to organize your searches:

```python
project = client.create_project(
    name="example-project",
    description="A project for searching company data",
    model_type="Mini"
)
```

## 5. Add a dataset

Add a dataset to your project. Each dataset must be a pickled pandas dataframe with an "embedding" column (containing OpenAI text-large-3 embeddings) and a "tag" column (containing associated string values).

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assuming you have a pickled dataframe named 'company_data.pkl'
dataset = pd.read_pickle("company_data.pkl")
project.add_dataset(name="company_dataset", data=dataset)
```

## 6. Activate the dataset

Activate your dataset to make it searchable:

```python
project.activate_dataset("company_dataset")
```

## 7. Add a machine

Add a machine to process search requests:

```python
project.add_machine()
```

## 8. Run a similarity search

Now you're ready to perform an intelligent search:

```python
results = project.search(
    query="companies that require HIPAA compliance",
    top_k=5,
    prob_threshold=0.7
)

for result in results:
    print(f"Company: {result.tag}, Probability: {result.prob}")
```
