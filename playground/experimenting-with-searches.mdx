Artemis Search's intelligent search technology allows you to perform complex, reasoning-based searches on your datasets. This guide will help you experiment with different types of searches and interpret the results effectively.

## Types of Searches

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Simple Keyword Search" >
    Start with basic keyword searches to familiarize yourself with the system.
    
    Example: "artificial intelligence"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Phrase Search" >
    Use quotes to search for exact phrases.
    
    Example: "machine learning applications in healthcare"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Conceptual Search" >
    Leverage Artemis Search's reasoning capabilities to find results based on concepts rather than just keywords.
    
    Example: "companies working on sustainable energy solutions"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Attribute-based Search" >
    Search for entities with specific attributes or characteristics.
    
    Example: "startups with female founders in the fintech industry"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Crafting Effective Queries

To get the most out of Artemis Search, consider the following tips when crafting your queries:

<Card title="Be Specific">
  The more specific your query, the more targeted your results will be. Instead of "tech companies," try "AI-powered cybersecurity startups founded after 2020."
</Card>

<Card title="Use Natural Language">
  Artemis Search understands context, so phrase your queries as you would a question to a human expert.
</Card>

<Card title="Combine Concepts">
  Don't hesitate to combine multiple concepts in a single query, such as "environmentally friendly manufacturing techniques in the automotive industry."
</Card>

## Interpreting Results

When you run a search in the Playground, you'll see a table of results. Here's how to interpret them:

<ResponseField name="tag" type="string">
  The content associated with the matching embedding from your dataset.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="proba" type="float">
  The probability (between 0 and 1) that the result matches your search query. Higher values indicate a stronger match.
</ResponseField>

<Tip>
  Pay attention to the 'proba' values to gauge the relevance of each result. You can adjust the 'Proba Threshold' in the Playground settings to filter out lower-probability matches.
</Tip>

## Example Searches

Let's walk through some example searches to demonstrate Artemis Search's capabilities:

<CodeGroup>

```plaintext "Companies that require HIPAA compliance"
This search will return companies in industries that typically need to comply with HIPAA regulations, such as healthcare providers, insurance companies, and health tech startups.
```

```plaintext "Sustainable fashion brands using recycled materials"
This query will find fashion companies that prioritize sustainability and specifically use recycled materials in their products.
```

```plaintext "AI startups focused on natural language processing"
This search targets AI companies specializing in NLP technologies, which could include chatbots, translation services, or text analysis tools.
```

</CodeGroup>

## Refining Your Searches

If you're not getting the results you expect, try these refinement techniques:

1. **Adjust specificity**: Make your query more or less specific to broaden or narrow the results.
2. **Use synonyms**: Try alternative words or phrases that express the same concept.
3. **Combine searches**: Use multiple related searches to cross-reference results.
4. **Tweak parameters**: Experiment with different Synthetic Dataset Sizes and Probability Thresholds.

  Remember, the power of Artemis Search lies in its ability to understand context and concepts. Don't be afraid to phrase your queries in a natural, detailed manner to get the most relevant results.
