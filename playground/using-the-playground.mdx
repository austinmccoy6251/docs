The Artemis Search Playground is a powerful tool that allows you to experiment with your search queries in real-time. This guide will walk you through the basics of using the Playground effectively.

## Accessing the Playground

To access the Playground:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to your project">
    Log in to your Artemis Search account and select the project you want to work with.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the Playground">
    Click on the "Open in Playground" button in the top-right corner of your project page.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Playground Layout

The Playground is divided into two main sections:

<Card title="Left Column: Settings and Search" icon="sliders">
  Configure your search parameters and enter your search query.
</Card>

<Card title="Right Column: Results" icon="table">
  View the paginated table of search results returned from your query.
</Card>

## Configuring Your Search

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Project Selection" icon="project-diagram">
    Use the 'Project' dropdown to select the activated project you want to experiment with.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Synthetic Dataset Size" icon="database">
    Adjust the 'Synthetic Dataset Size' input to control how much synthetic data is used for each search request. Our model generates this data to train on when searching.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Probability Threshold" icon="percentage">
    Set the 'Proba Threshold' to filter and keep only results above the specified probability. This reflects the likelihood that a result matches your search.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Top K Threshold" icon="sort-amount-down">
    Use the 'Top K Threshold' to filter and keep only the top-k results.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Running a Search

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter your query">
    In the 'Search Query' text area, enter the search query you want to test.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute the search">
    Click the 'Complete Search' button to run your search.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review results">
    Examine the paginated table of search results on the right side of the Playground. Each result displays the 'tag' and 'proba' (probability) associated with the search results.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Experiment with different queries and settings to fine-tune your search results and understand how Artemis Search's intelligent search technology works with your data.
