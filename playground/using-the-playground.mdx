## What is the Playground?
The Artemis Search Playground is a powerful tool that allows you to experiment with your projects.

## Accessing the Playground

To access the Playground:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to your project">
    Log in to your Artemis Search account and select the project you want to work with from the Project Dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the Playground">
    Click on the "Playground" button in the top-right corner of your project page.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Playground Layout

The Playground is divided into two main sections:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Left Column: Settings and Search" icon="sliders">
  Configure your search parameters and enter your search query.
</Card>

<Card title="Right Column: Results" icon="table">
  View the paginated table of search results returned from your query.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Configuring Your Search

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Project Selection" >
    Use the 'Project' dropdown to select the activated project you want to experiment with.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Synthetic Dataset Size" >
    Adjust the 'Synthetic Dataset Size' input to control how much synthetic data is used for each search request. Our model generates this data to train on when searching. This parameter can range from 1 to 70. Tuning this parameter allows you to balance search speed and result quality for your use case.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Probability Threshold" >
    Set the 'Proba Threshold' to filter and keep only results above the specified probability. This reflects the likelihood that a result matches your search. This parameter can range from 0 to 1. Tuning this parameter will truncate results but not affect search time.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Top K Threshold" >
    Use the 'Top K Threshold' to filter and keep only the top-k results. This value can range from 1 to Infinity. Tuning this parameter will truncate results but not affect search time.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Running a Search

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter your query">
    In the 'Search Query' text area, enter the search query you want to test.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute the search">
    Click the 'Complete Search' button to run your search.

    <Tip>
      The search will take between 5-20 seconds to complete. If this is your first time running a search, it may take longer as your machines are spun up.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review results">
    Examine the paginated table of search results on the right side of the Playground. Each result displays the 'tag' and 'proba' (probability) associated with the search results.
  </Step>
</Steps>
