Effective dataset management is key to maintaining an efficient and relevant search experience in Artemis Search. This guide covers the essential operations you can perform on your datasets.

## Viewing Datasets

To view all datasets associated with a project:

1. Click on the desired project card in the Project Dashboard.
2. Locate the "Datasets" card on the project page.
3. You'll see a table listing all datasets, including their names and status.

## Dataset Operations

For each dataset, you can perform the following actions:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Activate" icon="play">
    Set a dataset as the active one for your project's searches.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Edit" icon="pen-to-square">
    Modify the dataset's name or other metadata.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Delete" icon="trash">
    Remove a dataset from your project permanently.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How to Manage Datasets

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Dataset Options">
    Click the ellipsis (⋮) next to any dataset entry in the table to view available actions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose an Action">
    Select the desired operation from the dropdown menu:
    - Edit
    - Activate
    - Delete
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Action">
    Follow the prompts to complete the chosen action.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Activating a Dataset

<Note>
  Only one dataset can be active per project at a time. Activating a new dataset will automatically deactivate the previously active one.
</Note>
To activate a dataset:
1. Click the ellipsis (⋮) next to the dataset you want to activate.
2. Select "Activate" from the dropdown menu.
3. Confirm the action in the popup dialog.


## Editing a Dataset

Editing allows you to update the dataset's name:

1. Click the ellipsis (⋮) next to the dataset you want to edit.
2. Select "Edit" from the dropdown menu.
3. In the popup modal, enter the new name for your dataset.
4. Click "Save" to apply the changes.

## Deleting a Dataset
<Warning>
  Deleting a dataset is permanent and cannot be undone. Ensure you have a backup if needed.
</Warning>

To delete a dataset:

1. Click the ellipsis (⋮) next to the dataset you want to delete.
2. Select "Delete" from the dropdown menu.
3. Confirm the deletion in the popup dialog.


## Best Practices

- Regularly review and clean up unused datasets to maintain a streamlined project.
- Always ensure at least one dataset is active in your project for uninterrupted search functionality.
- Consider creating a backup before deleting or significantly modifying datasets.

By effectively managing your datasets, you can ensure that your Artemis Search project always uses the most relevant and up-to-date data for intelligent searches.
