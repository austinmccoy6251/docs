Datasets are at the core of Artemis Search's intelligent search technology. They consist of embeddings and associated tags, enabling our advanced search capabilities that excel at "reasoning" and outperform traditional RAG systems.

## What is a Dataset?

A dataset in Artemis Search is a collection of:

1. **Embeddings**: Vector representations of text data
2. **Tags**: Associated string values that provide context or metadata for each embedding

<Note>
  Each dataset must be a pickled pandas dataframe with an "embedding" column containing OpenAI text-large-3 embeddings and a "tag" column with associated string values.
</Note>

## Dataset Activation

Within a project, you can have multiple datasets, but only one can be active at a time. The active dataset is the one used for search queries in that project.

<Warning>
  At least one dataset must be active for a project to be operational and allow searches.
