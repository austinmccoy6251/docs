<Tip>
We have provided a limited sample dataset for you to explore with. It contains ~19,000 company descriptions. In the case you are unable to find matches for your searches, we recommend uploading a bigger dataset.
</Tip>

## What is a Dataset?

A Dataset stores the content that Artemis Search will search over.
Datasets must be pandas dataframes exported as a parquet file with an "embedding" column containing OpenAI text-large-3 embeddings and a "tag" column with associated string values.

<Note>
  Artemis Search only searches through activated datasets.

## Dataset Activation

Within a project, you can have multiple datasets, but only one can be active at a time. The active dataset is the one used for search queries in that project.

<Warning>
  At least one dataset must be active for a project to be operational and allow searches.
</Warning>

## Creating a Dataset

Datasets are simple to prepare but do require a few steps. Since there are many different workflows for creating datasets, we will present an example workflow for creating a dataset.

### Background
Suppose we have the following dataset stored in a Pandas dataframe:
| company_description | company_name | id |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| 'Acme is a startup that makes widgets' | 'Acme' | 1 |
| 'Wayne Enterprises is a startup that makes widgets' | 'Wayne Enterprises' | 2 |
| 'Parker Industries is a startup that makes widgets' | 'Parker Industries' | 3 |

### Example Workflow
<Steps>
  <Step title="Choosing Source Data">
    Artemis Search datasets consist of embeddings of the text you want to search over as well as associated string tags for each embedding. These tags could represent IDs, names, or any other unique information associated with your embedding.

    In our case, it would make the most sense to use `company_description` as the text we are embedding and the `id` as the tags. This choice makes sense since we want to be able to search over the company descriptions and the ids uniquely identify each company.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preparing the Dataset">
    
    Ultimately, we need to end up with Pandas dataframe exported as a parquet file where one column is 'embedding' and the other is 'tag'.

    Given our initial dataframe, we will need to transform the `company_description` column into embeddings and the `id` column into string tags, and then store the result as a parquet file.
  
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    from openai import OpenAI

    # Load Initial Dataframe
    df = pd.read_csv('company_descriptions.csv')

    # Create Embeddings
    client = OpenAI(api_key=env.process.API_KEY)
    text_to_embed = df['company_description'].tolist()
    embedding_responses = client.embeddings.create(input=text_to_embed, model='text-embedding-3-large')
    embeddings = np.vstack([embedding.embedding for embedding in embedding_responses.data])

    # Create Final Dataframe
    df['embedding'] = embeddings
    df['tag'] = df['id'].astype(str)

    # Save as a Parquet File
    df.to_parquet('../data/data.parquet')
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
