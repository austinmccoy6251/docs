Artemis Search is a powerful technology that allows you to perform "intelligent" searches on datasets consisting of embeddings and associated tags. Our search is designed to excel at searches that require "reasoning" and outperforms RAG.

<Note>
	To get started quickly, follow these steps to set up your first project and
	run a search.

</CardGroup>

## 2. Create a project

Once logged in, you'll be taken to the dashboard:

1. Click on the "Add Project" button.
2. Enter a name for your project.
3. Choose the "Mini" model type (currently the only available option).

## 3. Add a dataset

In your new project:

1. Navigate to the "Datasets" card.
2. Click "Add Dataset" at the bottom of the table.
3. Name your dataset and upload your file.

<Note>
	Each dataset must be a pickled pandas dataframe with an "embedding" column
	(containing OpenAI text-large-3 embeddings) and a "tag" column (containing
	associated string values).
</Note>

<Tip>
	You can use the provided `sample_company_dataset` with 1000 company
	descriptions from Crunchbase to get started quickly.
</Tip>

## 4. Activate your dataset

1. Click the ellipsis (â€¦) next to your dataset in the table.
2. Select "Activate" from the options.

## 5. Add a machine

1. Go to the "Machines" card.
2. Click "Add Machine" at the bottom of the table.
3. Wait for the machine to start up (stay on the page during this process).

## 6. Open the playground

Once your project is "active" (has at least one machine assigned and an activated dataset):

1. Click the "Open in Playground" button in the top-right corner of the project page.

## 7. Run your first search

In the playground:

1. Use the left column to configure your search settings.
2. Enter your search query in the "Search Query" text area.
3. Click the "Complete Search" button.

Your search results will appear in the right column, displaying the associated tags and probabilities for each result.
