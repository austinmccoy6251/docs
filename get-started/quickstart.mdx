Artemis Search is a powerful technology that allows you to perform "intelligent" searches on datasets consisting of embeddings and associated tags. Our search is designed to excel at searches that require "reasoning" and outperforms RAG.

<Note>
  To get started quickly, follow these steps to set up your first project and run a search.

## 1. Sign up for an account

Create an account or log in to Artemis Search:

## 2. Create a project

Projects are the highest level of organization, each dedicated to a specific search task.

Once logged in, you'll be taken to the dashboard:

1. Click on the "Add Project" button.
2. Enter a name for your project.
3. Choose the "Mini" model type (currently the only available option).

## 3. Add a dataset

Datasets contain the information you want to search through, consisting of embeddings and associated tags.

In your new project:

1. Navigate to the "Datasets" card.
2. Click "Add Dataset" at the bottom of the table.
3. Name your dataset and upload your file.

<Note>
  Each dataset must be a pickled pandas dataframe with an "embedding" column (containing OpenAI text-large-3 embeddings) and a "tag" column (containing associated string values).
</Note>

<Tip>
  You can use the provided `sample_company_dataset` with 1000 company descriptions from Crunchbase to get started quickly.
</Tip>

## 4. Activate your dataset

Activating a dataset makes it the current dataset used for searches in your project.

1. Click the ellipsis (â€¦) next to your dataset in the table.
2. Select "Activate" from the options.

<Note>
  Only one dataset can be active per project. Activating a new dataset will automatically deactivate the previously active one.
</Note>

## 5. Add a machine

Machines are the computational resources that run our ML model on your dataset to process search requests.

1. Go to the "Machines" card.
2. Click "Add Machine" at the bottom of the table.
3. Wait for the machine to start up (stay on the page during this process).

<Note>
  Adding a machine may take a few minutes. Your project needs at least one machine to be operational.
</Note>

## 6. Open the playground

The playground is where you can experiment with searches and fine-tune parameters.

Once your project is "active" (has at least one machine assigned and an activated dataset):

1. Click the "Open in Playground" button in the top-right corner of the project page.

## 7. Run your first search

In the playground:

1. Use the left column to configure your search settings:
   - Adjust the "Synthetic Dataset Size" to control how much synthetic data is used for each search.
   - Set the "Proba Threshold" to filter results based on their probability of matching the search.
   - Adjust the "Top K Threshold" to limit the number of results returned.
2. Enter your search query in the "Search Query" text area.
3. Click the "Complete Search" button.

Your search results will appear in the right column, displaying the associated tags and probabilities for each result.
