## Result Structure

Each search result in Artemis Search contains the following key components:

<ResponseField name="tag" type="string">
  The content associated with the matching embedding from your dataset.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="proba" type="float">
  The probability (between 0 and 1) that the result matches your search query.
</ResponseField>

## Understanding Probability Scores

The `proba` value indicates how likely it is that the result matches your search criteria:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="High Probability (> 0.8)" icon="circle-check">
    Strong match to your search query. These results are highly relevant.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Medium Probability (0.5 - 0.8)" icon="circle-half-stroke">
    Moderate match. May be relevant but requires closer examination.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Low Probability (< 0.5)" icon="circle-exclamation">
    Weak match. Less likely to be relevant to your search query.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Analyzing Search Results

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Top Results">
    Start by examining the results with the highest probability scores. These are most likely to be relevant to your search query.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Consider Context">
    Remember that Artemis Search understands context. A result might not contain exact keywords but could still be highly relevant due to semantic understanding.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Examine Tags">
    The `tag` field contains the actual content associated with the result. Analyze this to understand why it was returned for your query.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Adjust Parameters">
    If you're not getting the expected results, consider adjusting your [search parameters](/search/search-parameters) such as the probability threshold or synthetic dataset size.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Interpretation

<CodeGroup>

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "tag": "HealthTech Inc: A leading provider of HIPAA-compliant healthcare software solutions.",
      "proba": 0.95
    },
    {
      "tag": "SecureData Systems: Offers data protection services for various industries.",
      "proba": 0.72
    },
    {
      "tag": "MediCare Innovations: Developing new medical devices for hospitals.",
      "proba": 0.45
    }
  ]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

In this example:
1. "HealthTech Inc" is highly relevant (0.95 probability) and explicitly mentions HIPAA compliance.
2. "SecureData Systems" is moderately relevant (0.72 probability). While not specifically mentioning HIPAA, it's in a related field.
3. "MediCare Innovations" has a lower relevance (0.45 probability). It's in the medical field but doesn't indicate HIPAA compliance.

{/* ## Visualizing Results

<Note>
  The following is a placeholder for a data visualization component. In a real implementation, this would be a dynamic chart based on actual search results.
</Note>

```jsx
import { BarChart, Bar, XAxis, YAxis, Tooltip, Legend, ResponsiveContainer } from 'recharts';

const data = [
  { name: 'HealthTech Inc', probability: 0.95 },
  { name: 'SecureData Systems', probability: 0.72 },
  { name: 'MediCare Innovations', probability: 0.45 },
];

const ResultChart = () => (
  <ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height={300}>
    <BarChart data={data}>
      <XAxis dataKey="name" />
      <YAxis />
      <Tooltip />
      <Legend />
      <Bar dataKey="probability" fill="#0D9373" />
    </BarChart>
  </ResponsiveContainer>
);

export default ResultChart;
``` */}
